# Source code used in the NIST SRE2016 challenge
In addition to the main bash script, this repository contains some code augmentations to Kaldi: 
- [DCF calculator]()
- [Nonlinear discrimininant analysis]()
- 

NOTE: NDA Hasn't improved LDA results in our in-home experiments. May contain some bugs in the implementation. 
Feel free to use this project in any capacity on top of your kaldi-based SID systems. 
Please let me know if you have any comments, or corrections.
